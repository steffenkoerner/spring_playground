# Spring Boot Playground
Welcome to the Spring Boot Playground! This repository serves as my experimentation ground for exploring Spring Boot after completing my Java Backend Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.


## Introduction
Spring Boot is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a convention-over-configuration approach. It eliminates the need for boilerplate code and allows developers to focus on building robust and scalable applications.

With its opinionated defaults and auto-configuration capabilities, Spring Boot minimizes the setup and configuration tasks, enabling rapid application development. It integrates seamlessly with various technologies and frameworks, making it an excellent choice for building microservices, RESTful APIs, and web applications.

## Projects

### API
In the api folder, you will find an implementation of REST and GraphQL endpoints. This project showcases how to build APIs using Spring Boot. The REST implementation follows the traditional request-response model, while the GraphQL implementation leverages the power of the GraphQL query language for flexible data fetching.

### Topics Coming Soon

- Microservices with Eureka

Stay tuned for more exciting projects and topics to explore in the Spring Boot Playground!
